2. ./getribs.py : 
Usage: python ./getribs.py

Usage: python decompress_ribs.py <from_folder> <to_folder>
Decompress RIBS downloaded in folder beginning <from_folder>  to <to_folder>

4. ./generate_txt.py

Generated txt file of RIBS from decompressed RIBS beginning <from_folder>  to <to_folder>
NOTE: Needs ./zebra-dump-parser in directory.

5. ./zebra-dump-parser

Steps:
1. Run python ./getribs.py
2. Run python decompress_ribs.py <from_folder> <to_folder>. Decompression may take time. Divide tasks in small range of 
<from_folder> <to_folder>
3. Run python generate_txt.py <from_folder> <to_folder>
