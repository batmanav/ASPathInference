This program parses a dump of BGP routes in the zebra/MRT format.

If you do not want to collect your own BGP dumps then a popular source 
for them is the RIPE RIS service, e.g.:
http://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc00/2003.04/bview.20030408.0000.gz

A good list of descriptions of ASNs is available at
http://www.potaroo.net/bgp/iana/asn-ctl.txt .


To test aslookup.pl you can set $format = 1 and then run:

zcat bview.20030321.1600.gz | time ./zebra-dump-parser.pl >DUMP 2>DUMPERR
sort < DUMP | uniq | time ./aggregate-by-asn.pl > routes.tmp
mv routes.tmp routes


If you do something interesting with this software then feel free to
